## Acknowledgments
This includes [Flavio Curella](https://github.com/fcurella)'s awesome package [JSX Lexer](https://github.com/fcurella/jsx-lexer), and includes the ideas and some code from Igor [Hatarist](https://github.com/hatarist)'s stab at this same problem [pygments-tsx](https://github.com/hatarist/pygments-tsx). Flaws were introduced by StartupOS, good stuff came from them.

There's also a hack in here for forcing pygments to accept classes programatically. That was based on discussions in this [thread](https://github.com/pygments/pygments/issues/1096), and specifically suggestions from [Vincent Bernat](https://github.com/vincentbernat) and [Jean Abou-Samra](https://github.com/jeanas)
